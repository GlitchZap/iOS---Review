      "Arrange regular playdates with one child at a time. Large groups can be overwhelming—one-on-one play allows children to practice sharing, turn-taking, and conflict resolution with support.",
      "Stay nearby during playdates for young children, ready to coach in the moment: 'Maya wants a turn. What could you say to her?' rather than solving it for them or just saying 'Share!'",
      "Use pretend play to practice social situations. Play 'friends at school' with stuffed animals or dolls. Act out scenarios like joining a game or dealing with someone who's mean.",
      "Board games, cooperative games, and sports teach turn-taking, winning and losing gracefully, and working toward shared goals. Choose age-appropriate options and expect learning curves.",
      "Celebrate social effort, not just successful outcomes: 'I saw you ask to join that game—that was brave!' Even if it didn't work out perfectly, they're building important skills."

      "Teach conversation basics: how to start ('What are you playing?'), how to keep going (asking questions, sharing something related), and how to end ('Bye! See you tomorrow!').",
      "Role-play common situations at home: 'Let's practice what you could say if someone takes your toy.' Give them actual words to use: 'Hey, I was playing with that. Can I have a turn?'",
      "Help children read social cues: 'Look at Maya's face. Does she look like she wants to play that game, or not?' Point out body language and tone of voice as clues.",
      "Teach repair skills for when things go wrong: how to apologize sincerely, how to ask to start over, how to give space and try again later. Everyone makes social mistakes—repair is key.",
      "Model the skills you want to see. Narrate your own social interactions: 'I'm going to ask Mrs. Johnson how her day is going—that's a friendly thing to do.' Children learn from watching you."

    "tips": [
      "Respect their temperament. Some children are naturally more cautious in social situations. This isn't a problem to fix—it's a trait to work with. Slow-to-warm children often become thoughtful friends.",
      "Don't force interactions or speak for them. Saying 'Say hi to Mrs. Chen' on the spot usually backfires. Instead, prepare them: 'We're going to see Mrs. Chen—you can wave or say hi if you want.'",
      "Give them time to warm up. Arrive at parties or playdates early so they can settle in before the crowd. Let them observe from the sidelines before expecting participation.",
      "Find their social strengths. Maybe they're great one-on-one but struggle in groups. Maybe they shine in structured activities but not free play. Build on what works.",
      "Avoid labeling them as 'shy' in their hearing. Children live up to labels. Instead try 'She takes her time getting to know new people—she's really observant.'"
