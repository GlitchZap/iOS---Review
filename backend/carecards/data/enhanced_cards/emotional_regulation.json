      "Help children build emotional vocabulary: frustrated, disappointed, nervous, excited, jealous, overwhelmed. 'It looks like you might be feeling disappointed that we can't go to the park.'",
      "Use books, shows, and daily life to discuss emotions: 'How do you think that character feels? What clues tell you that?' This builds emotional intelligence in low-stress moments.",
      "Share your own emotions appropriately: 'I'm feeling frustrated that traffic is so slow. I'm going to take some deep breaths.' This models both emotion identification and coping.",
      "Validate before you problem-solve: 'You're really sad that your friend moved away. That's such a hard feeling.' Acknowledged emotions pass more quickly than dismissed ones.",
      "Create a feelings chart or poster they can point to when they can't find words. Sometimes 'I feel like the angry emoji' is a great start when they're still developing vocabulary."

    "tips": [
      "Teach deep breathing with kid-friendly cues: 'Smell the flowers (breathe in), blow out the candles (breathe out)' or 'Take a balloon breath—fill your belly up, then slowly let the air out.'",
      "Physical movement helps process emotions: running outside, jumping on a mini trampoline, squeezing a stress ball, or pushing against a wall. Big feelings need physical release.",
      "Create a 'calm-down kit' together: playdough, squishy toys, coloring pages, calming music playlist, photos of happy memories. Let them choose what goes in it—they know what helps them.",
      "Practice strategies when calm, not during meltdowns. You can't learn to swim while drowning. Regular practice when relaxed means the skills are accessible during upset.",
      "Different strategies work for different children—and different situations. Help them notice: 'Deep breathing works best when you're worried, but running helps more when you're angry.'"

    "subtitle": "Children learn to self-soothe through being soothed",
    "tips": [
      "Young children can't self-regulate alone—they need a calm adult presence to borrow regulation from. Your steady breathing, soft voice, and relaxed body help regulate their nervous system.",
      "Stay physically close during big emotions if they'll let you. Sometimes silent presence—sitting nearby, a hand on their back—communicates support without requiring them to listen to words.",
      "The goal isn't to eliminate emotions but to help them move through. 'I'm right here while you feel this big feeling. It will pass.' Emotions are like waves—they rise and fall.",
      "After the emotion passes, reflect together: 'That was a big feeling. What did you notice in your body? What helped you start to feel better?' Build self-awareness over time.",
      "Take care of your own regulation. You can't pour from an empty cup. If you're frequently dysregulated, your child can't borrow calm from you. Parental self-care is child care."
