      "Say 'You worked so hard on that!' rather than 'You're so smart!' Praising effort teaches that achievement comes from work, not fixed talent. This builds resilience when things get hard.",
      "Be specific in your praise: 'I noticed you kept trying even when the puzzle was frustrating' rather than generic 'Good job!' Specific praise tells them exactly what behavior to repeat.",
      "Celebrate the process, not just outcomes: 'What was your favorite part of making that?' 'What was tricky about it?' This shows you value their effort and learning journey, not just the finished product.",
      "Normalize failure as part of learning: 'Everyone makes mistakes when they're learning something new—that's how our brains grow!' Share your own mistakes and what you learned from them.",
      "Avoid over-praising everything. When everything gets 'amazing!' nothing feels special. Save enthusiastic praise for genuine effort and let some things simply be: 'You finished your drawing. Let's put it on the fridge.'"

    "subtitle": "Rescued children don't learn they can cope",
    "tips": [
      "Resist the urge to jump in and fix everything. When your child struggles with a zipper, a puzzle, or a friendship issue, pause and ask 'Would you like help, or do you want to try yourself?'",
      "Tolerate their frustration without rescuing. Say 'This is hard! I believe you can figure it out' rather than taking over. Mastering something difficult builds genuine confidence.",
      "Break challenges into smaller steps if they're overwhelmed: 'First, line up the zipper at the bottom. Good. Now try pulling up slowly.' Support without doing it for them.",
      "Celebrate struggle as much as success: 'You tried three different ways before it worked—that's exactly what scientists do!' Frame difficulty as evidence of meaningful work.",
      "Let natural consequences teach when safe. If they forget homework, don't rush to rescue. Experiencing the consequence builds responsibility and confidence in their ability to handle outcomes."

    "subtitle": "Contribution builds capability",
    "tips": [
      "Assign age-appropriate household tasks and treat them as real contributions: 'We need you to set the table because that's your important job in our family.' Responsibility builds competence and belonging.",
      "Let them make age-appropriate decisions: what to wear, which snack to have, which book to read. Practice making choices in low-stakes situations prepares them for bigger decisions later.",
      "Involve them in family problem-solving: 'We're always running late in the mornings. What ideas do you have?' Children who contribute to solutions feel capable and valued.",
      "Accept imperfect results. Yes, they'll put the forks on the wrong side. Yes, their bed-making will be lumpy. The goal is building capability and confidence, not perfect outcomes.",
      "Gradually increase autonomy as they demonstrate readiness. Walk them to a friend's house, then watch from down the street, then let them go alone. Build independence step by step."
