      "Start your wind-down routine 30-60 minutes before the desired sleep time. This gives your child's body time to naturally produce melatonin and transition from active play to restful state.",
      "Follow the same sequence every night: perhaps bath, pajamas, brush teeth, story, song, lights out. The predictable pattern becomes a powerful sleep cue that tells their brain 'sleep is coming.'",
      "Keep the routine calm and screen-free. Blue light from devices suppresses melatonin production for up to 2 hours. Trade screens for books, puzzles, or quiet imaginative play.",
      "Include some one-on-one connection time—a chat about their day, gratitude sharing, or cuddling. This emotional connection helps children feel secure enough to separate for the night.",
      "Be consistent even on weekends. A regular sleep schedule regulates their internal clock (circadian rhythm). More than 1 hour variation can disrupt sleep for several days."

    "tips": [
      "Keep the bedroom cool (65-70°F/18-21°C), dark, and quiet. Our bodies naturally drop in temperature during sleep, so a cooler room supports this biological process.",
      "Use blackout curtains to block streetlights and early morning sun. Even small amounts of light can disrupt melatonin production and cause early waking during light sleep phases.",
      "Consider a white noise machine to mask household sounds and create a consistent audio environment. The steady sound can become a sleep association that helps them fall back asleep if they wake.",
      "Remove stimulating toys and electronics from the bedroom. The bed should be associated with sleep, not play. Keep exciting toys in another room for daytime use.",
      "A comfort object like a special stuffed animal or blanket can provide security. This 'transitional object' helps children self-soothe when they wake briefly during normal sleep cycles."

    "tips": [
      "Keep night interactions boring and brief. Use a soft voice, minimal eye contact, and low lighting. You want to reassure without fully waking them or making nighttime visits rewarding.",
      "If they come to your room, walk them back to their bed calmly and consistently. Yes, you might do this many times initially, but consistency teaches them that their bed is where they sleep.",
      "Check that basic needs are met: not too hot or cold, not thirsty, not having a nightmare. Address the need simply, then back to the sleep expectation with minimal fuss.",
      "Avoid starting habits you don't want to continue—like lying with them until they fall asleep every night. Whatever method helps them fall asleep is what they'll need when they wake at 2am.",
      "Consider a 'sleep training clock' that turns green when it's okay to get up. This gives children a concrete, visual cue they can understand and gives you backup for explaining expectations."

    "tips": [
      "Toddlers (1-3 years) need 11-14 hours of sleep per 24 hours, including naps. An overtired toddler often becomes hyperactive rather than sleepy—watch for that 'second wind' as a sign they're past their window.",
      "Preschoolers (3-5 years) need 10-13 hours. Most drop their nap between 3-5 years. If bedtime becomes a battle, the nap might be too long or too late in the day.",
      "School-age children (6-12 years) need 9-12 hours. With school, activities, and homework, it's easy to underestimate how early bedtime needs to be. Count backwards from wake time.",
      "Signs of insufficient sleep include: difficulty waking, falling asleep in the car, behavioral issues, difficulty concentrating, and getting sick more often. These often improve dramatically with more sleep.",
      "Watch for your child's natural sleep window—that 15-30 minute period when they show sleepy cues. Putting them down during this window results in easier falling asleep than fighting past it."
