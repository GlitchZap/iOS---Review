      "Get on their level, make eye contact, and acknowledge what they're feeling before addressing behavior. 'I see you're really frustrated that your tower fell' works better than 'Stop screaming!'",
      "Children who feel connected to their caregivers are naturally more cooperative. Invest in regular one-on-one time, even just 10 focused minutes daily, and behavior often improves.",
      "Remember that all behavior is communication. Ask yourself: What need is my child trying to meet? Are they tired, hungry, needing attention, feeling powerless, or overwhelmed?",
      "Stay calm during misbehavior. Your regulated nervous system helps regulate theirs. If you respond with anger, the situation escalates. If you stay calm, it contains.",
      "After addressing the behavior, reconnect with a hug or kind words. Children need to know that your love isn't conditional on perfect behavior. The relationship always comes first."

    "title": "Set Clear Expectations",
    "subtitle": "Children thrive with predictable boundaries",
    "tips": [
      "State expectations clearly and positively: 'We walk inside' rather than 'Don't run.' Children's brains hear the action word most clearly—tell them what TO do, not just what not to do.",
      "Keep rules simple and few. Young children can only remember 3-5 key rules. Focus on the most important ones (usually about safety and respect) and let smaller things go.",
      "Give advance warnings before transitions: 'In 5 minutes, we're going to clean up and get ready for dinner.' Sudden changes trigger resistance in children who need time to shift gears.",
      "Be consistent. If jumping on the couch isn't allowed, it's not allowed today either. Inconsistent enforcement confuses children and leads to more testing of boundaries.",
      "Use visual schedules or charts for routines. Many behavior challenges are actually about children not knowing what comes next. When they can see the sequence, they can follow it."

    "subtitle": "Let the world teach when it's safe to do so",
    "tips": [
      "Natural consequences teach more effectively than punishment. If they refuse to wear a jacket, they get cold. If they break a toy in anger, the toy is broken. Reality is the teacher.",
      "Only use natural consequences when they're safe and immediate. A consequence that happens days later or is dangerous (running into traffic) doesn't apply—you need to intervene directly.",
      "Resist the urge to say 'I told you so.' Simply empathize: 'You're cold now without your jacket. That's uncomfortable.' Let them experience the lesson without adding shame.",
      "For situations where natural consequences don't work, use logical consequences that are related, reasonable, and respectful. Losing iPad time because of fighting over the iPad makes sense.",
      "Focus on problem-solving together: 'The toy got broken when you threw it. What can we do to make this better?' This teaches responsibility better than punishment."
