      "Interactive, educational content differs from passive consumption. A video call with grandma, an age-appropriate learning game, or a creative drawing app engages children differently than endless YouTube videos.",
      "Co-view when possible—discuss what you're watching, ask questions, and connect screen content to real life. This transforms passive watching into active learning and strengthens your relationship.",
      "Preview content before allowing it. Check age ratings, reviews from Common Sense Media, and watch a few minutes yourself. What seems benign can have surprisingly mature themes.",
      "Help children understand that what they see online may not reflect reality. Talk about advertising, filters, and how videos are edited. Build media literacy from an early age.",
      "Encourage content creation over consumption when appropriate. Making videos, building in Minecraft, or coding simple games involves more learning than passively watching others."

      "Create consistent rules about when screens are allowed and for how long. Visual timers help children see time passing and prepare for transitions. 'When the timer goes off, we're done.'",
      "Establish screen-free zones and times: bedrooms, the dinner table, and the hour before bed. These non-negotiable boundaries protect sleep, family connection, and physical activity.",
      "Model healthy tech habits yourself. Children notice when you're scrolling instead of listening. Designate device-free family time when everyone—parents included—unplugs.",
      "Offer engaging alternatives to screens. Boredom is often behind screen requests. Have a basket of activities ready: arts and crafts, building toys, outdoor equipment, books, or puzzles.",
      "Don't use screens as the primary soothing or reward tool. If screen time becomes the go-to for every tantrum or bribe, it gains excessive power. Keep it as one option among many."

    "subtitle": "Protect the golden hour before bed",
    "tips": [
      "Stop all screens at least 1 hour before bedtime. Blue light from devices suppresses melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep and reducing sleep quality even after they do.",
      "Keep all devices—phones, tablets, TVs—out of the bedroom. Even if they're not using them, the presence and potential for use disrupts sleep. Charge devices in a common area.",
      "The stimulating content on screens keeps young brains alert and processing, the opposite of the calm wind-down state needed for sleep. Even 'calm' content is more stimulating than books or quiet play.",
      "Replace evening screen time with calming activities: bath time, reading together, gentle play, talking about the day, or listening to soft music or audiobooks.",
      "If your child struggles to sleep, the first thing to examine is their screen habits—both the timing and the content. A screen break often dramatically improves sleep within days."
