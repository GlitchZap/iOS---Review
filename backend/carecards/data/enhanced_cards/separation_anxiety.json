      "Keep goodbyes brief but warm. Long, drawn-out departures with multiple hugs and reassurances actually increase anxiety by signaling that the separation is a big deal worth worrying about.",
      "Never sneak away. It might seem easier in the moment, but it erodes trust and increases anxiety about future separations. They need to know you won't disappear without warning.",
      "Create a goodbye ritual: a special handshake, three kisses, 'I love you, I'll be back.' Predictable rituals give children something to hold onto and mark the transition clearly.",
      "Use matter-of-fact language: 'Mommy is going to work now. I'll pick you up after snack time. You're going to have fun with your friends.' Confidence is contagious—so is anxiety.",
      "Trust the caregivers. In most cases, children calm down within minutes of parents leaving. Ask them to text you an update. Knowing your child recovered quickly helps you stay calm too."

    "tips": [
      "Start with small separations and build up gradually. Short visits to grandma's house or a trusted friend prepare children for longer separations like school or daycare.",
      "Play peek-a-boo and hide-and-seek with younger children. These games teach the fundamental concept that people go away and come back—object permanence applied to relationships.",
      "Leave your child with trusted caregivers regularly, even if you don't need to. Children who only separate when absolutely necessary don't get practice building their 'I can do this' muscle.",
      "Read books about separation and school. Stories normalize the experience and give children language and strategies. 'The Kissing Hand' and 'Llama Llama Misses Mama' are popular favorites.",
      "Talk positively about the place you're leaving them and the people there. Your attitude shapes theirs. 'Your teacher is so kind' rather than 'I hope they treat you okay.'"

    "subtitle": "Knowing when separation anxiety needs extra support",
    "tips": [
      "Some separation anxiety is developmentally normal and peaks around 8-14 months, and again between 18 months and 3 years. These phases pass with time and patient consistency.",
      "Concerning signs include: anxiety that lasts beyond a few minutes, physical symptoms like stomachaches or headaches, nightmares about separation, or refusal to go to previously enjoyed places.",
      "Avoid accommodating the anxiety by letting them skip school or activities. This provides short-term relief but reinforces that the situation is dangerous, making anxiety worse long-term.",
      "Work with teachers and caregivers on a consistent plan. Everyone should respond the same way to the anxiety—with warmth, confidence, and the expectation that the child can cope.",
      "If separation anxiety significantly impacts daily life for more than a few weeks, consider consulting a child psychologist. Early intervention for anxiety disorders is highly effective."
