    "tips": [
      "Your job as a parent is to decide WHAT food is offered, WHEN meals happen, and WHERE eating takes place. Your child's job is to decide WHETHER they eat and HOW MUCH. This simple division prevents most food battles.",
      "Serve meals at consistent times so children come to the table hungry but not famished. Erratic eating schedules and constant grazing mean they're never truly hungry at mealtimes.",
      "Include at least one food you know they like at each meal, alongside new or less-preferred foods. This ensures they can eat something while being exposed to variety without pressure.",
      "Trust their hunger and fullness cues. Children are born knowing how to regulate intake—'clean your plate' pressure overrides this natural ability and can lead to overeating later in life.",
      "Avoid becoming a short-order cook. Offer one meal for the family. If they choose not to eat, that's okay—they'll eat at the next scheduled meal or snack time."

    "title": "Handling Picky Eaters",
    "subtitle": "Selectivity is normal and usually temporary",
    "tips": [
      "It can take 10-15 exposures to a new food before a child accepts it—without any pressure. Keep offering foods they've rejected before. Their taste preferences genuinely change over time.",
      "Celebrate small wins: touching, smelling, licking, or even just tolerating the food on their plate. Each interaction is a step toward eventual acceptance, even if they don't eat it today.",
      "Avoid labeling your child as a 'picky eater' within their hearing. Children live up to the labels we give them. Instead, try 'You're still learning about new foods.'",
      "Make one meal for everyone rather than cooking separately for your picky eater. Family-style serving where everyone takes what they want teaches that all foods are normal parts of meals.",
      "Never use dessert as a reward for eating dinner. This elevates sweet foods to 'special' status and makes vegetables seem like an obstacle. Serve small desserts alongside meals occasionally."

    "subtitle": "Connection and nutrition come together at the table",
    "tips": [
      "Aim for at least one device-free family meal per day. Research shows children who eat with family have better nutrition, vocabulary, academic performance, and mental health outcomes.",
      "Focus on connection, not consumption. Family meals should be pleasant—avoid battles about eating. Talk about everyone's day, tell stories, play conversation games.",
      "Model healthy eating yourself—children learn more from watching than from being told. Eat your vegetables with enjoyment, try new foods openly, and show a healthy relationship with food.",
      "Let children help with meal preparation in age-appropriate ways. Children who help cook are more likely to eat the food they've made. Even toddlers can wash vegetables or tear lettuce.",
      "Keep mealtimes relatively short (15-20 minutes for younger children). Don't let meals drag on for an hour in hopes they'll eat more. When they're done, they're done."
