After talking to experts and doing research, I learned that my daughter may just have a high level of emotional sensitivity.\n\nSome children experience emotions more deeply than others. They may get angry more often, feel frustrated faster, and get overly excited compared to their peers.\n\nThe ability to regulate big emotions is largely dependent on age and development. Experiencing things more intensely is also sometimes just part of who someone is.\n\n\n\nHere's what I learned about managing my daughter's emotional sensitivity, plus ways parents can help highly sensitive children deal with their own big emotions.\n\nPhoto: Madelyn Goodnight\n\nWhat Is Emotional Sensitivity?\n\nEmotional sensitivity is a phrase that describes how a person responds to their environment. While the concept isn't clearly defined, nor is it something a person will be diagnosed with, some researchers have described it as \"heightened emotional reactivity\" or a \"tendency to have emotional reactions.\"\n\nAnother common term used for emotional sensitivity is \"highly sensitive.\" It generally applies to people who feel emotions more intensely or who have bigger emotional reactions to things.\n\nMost children are born emotionally sensitive by nature, but as they get older, they learn different strategies for managing their emotions. That said, some kids may continue having higher sensitivity, and as a parent or caregiver, you may notice it around the time they're 5 or 6 years old.\n\nAs your child's peers cut back on tantrums and meltdowns and your child does not, it may be a sign that your child is highly sensitive or has a high level of emotional sensitivity.\n\nBefore a child reaches 24 months and sometimes even as old as 36 months, their ability to inhibit behavior is typically low. This doesn't mean you can't start teaching them how to manage their emotions, though. By the time they start preschool, many kids have the skills needed to begin learning how to regulate their emotions.\n\nHelping a Highly Sensitive Child\n\nBig emotions can make life more difficult for kids unless they learn to engage in emotional regulation. While this is naturally learned over time, there are ways you can help your child cultivate emotional awareness and adopt healthy coping skills now.\n\nValidate their feelings\n\nWhen your child cries after an elbow scrape that didn't even break the skin, your first instinct may be telling them to calm down or reassuring them that their injury wasn't bad. But experts say that negating their feelings could just make matters worse, especially if your child hears anger or frustration in your voice.\n\n\n\n\"When you try to talk your kid out of what they're feeling, it causes them to hold on to that feeling more tightly and get even more upset,\" says Elinor Bashe, PsyD, a child psychologist in Highland Park, New Jersey. \"It's important to listen to and accept your child's emotions even if they don't seem logical.\" For instance, you could say something like, \"I know it hurts,\" or, \"You must have been surprised when you fell down.\"\n\n\n\nHelp children name their emotions\n\nChildren should recognize and define how they're feeling\u2014and you can help by teaching them about emotions. Say, \u201cYou look sad right now,\u201d or \u201cI can tell you're mad.\u201d Name your emotions, too, by stating, \u201cI'm sad that we can\u2019t go visit Grandma today,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m surprised that those boys were being so mean.\u201d\n\nYou can also strike up conversations by talking about characters in books or on TV shows. Every once in a while, ask questions such as, \u201cHow do you think this character feels?\u201d With practice, your child\u2019s ability to label their emotions will improve.\n\n\n\nEmpower them with information\n\nYoung kids love to be in the know, so use that to your advantage. If your child is scared about getting shots, for example, talk with them before their annual checkup. Explain how the shot prevents a specific disease.\n\nAlso, let your child have some control over the situation For example, once you're in the doctor's office, ask if they want the vaccine in their left arm or right, then let them choose the type of treat (a sticker or a new pencil, for instance) afterward.\n\n\n\nSet realistic expectations\n\nAnother way to help your child feel in control: Set realistic expectations before trying something new. For instance, if your highly sensitive child is attempting a 300-piece puzzle and you expect it to end in a meltdown, prep them ahead of time. You could say something like: \"This is harder than your other puzzles, so it's probably going to take a couple of days. Maybe we should work on it together?\"\n\n\n\nTeach them coping skills\n\nCoping skills can help your child manage emotions. Read our ideas below, and then, before they're heading into a situation that may lead to big feelings, give reminders about using them. Model them yourself as well, because kids learn a lot from watching their caregivers.\n\n\n\nPractice deep breathing . Teach your child how to breathe in slowly and quietly through their nose and then out through their mouth. (Try telling them to \"smell a flower, then blow up a balloon\" to master this.) You may do this together during upsetting moments, but encourage them to employ deep breathing on their own when needed.\n\n.

Help your child brainstorm a few positive affirmations to calm themselves down, such as \"Everybody makes mistakes. I will just practice and get better\", \"I can't always get my way\" and so on.\n\n\n\nHelp your child brainstorm a few positive affirmations to calm themselves down, such as \"Everybody makes mistakes.

Numbering the ceiling tiles, counting to 10, or counting down from 100 are just a few mental tasks that might reduce their distress.\n\n.

Identify mood boosters. Talk to your child about the things they like to do when they're happy, like playing outside, reading a joke book, or singing their favorite songs. Write those things down as \"mood boosters.\" When they're feeling bad,", "domain": "www.parents.com"}
