For example, calling grandparents who live far away or a parent who is out of town for work. This can be a great way for families to keep in touch over long distances.\n\nHowever, 2018 research shows that children have a hard time understanding the experience without an adult on their end to model and explain. Make sure that someone is always holding the child and encouraging engagement during these calls.", "domain": "www.healthline.com"}
