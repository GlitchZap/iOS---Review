Everyone experiences anxiety from time to time. It alerts us to threats, protects us from danger and helps us reach important goals.\n\nAnxiety isn\u2019t dangerous. Although anxiety feels uncomfortable, it is temporary and will eventually decrease. The body sensations we experience when we\u2019re anxious, are designed to keep us safe.\n\nAnxiety shouldn\u2019t be avoided. It\u2019s important to resist allowing your child to avoid challenges or escape scary situations. Your child may feel better in the short-term when they stay home or opt out, but in the long-term it makes things worse as your child never gets to learn they can handle the tuff-stuff.\n\nAnxiety can take over. Although anxiety is normal, harmless, and part of everyday life, for some children it can take over. Anxiety can flood children with unpleasant physical feelings, unwanted thoughts, and result in avoidance or opting out of important routines such as playing a sport, making friends, going to school, and more.", "domain": "www.anxietycanada.com"}
