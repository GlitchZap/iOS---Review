That's because your child is about to embark on a learning adventure that will go beyond their ABCs.\n\nThe kindergarten classroom will help your child boost their social and emotional skills. It is a powerful experience that can help set your child up for academic success, create lasting friendships, and help teach them a love of learning that can last a lifetime.\n\nThere are many ways you can help your child get ready for their first day of kindergarten. We talked with education experts and teachers to find out the best ways to prepare your kid for the first day of kindergarten.\n\n1. Meet the Teacher\n\nIt's important for your child to visit their new school before the first day of kindergarten. An in-person visit will help them feel prepared for this big change in their little lives, and it will also help to alleviate fears about knowing where the bathroom is and where to put their belongings.\n\nJulie Keyes, founder of The Educational Consultant A key thing to consider when starting school is to focus on making the unknown known as far as possible. \u2014 Julie Keyes, founder of The Educational Consultant\n\nAnna Taylor, an early years and elementary teacher, also suggests that parents teach their child a very simple question once they know their teacher's name: \"Can you help me, please?\"\n\n\"I explicitly teach my little ones the phrase,\" says Taylor, so they know who they can go to if they need help.\n\n2. Read About the First Day of School\n\nMake your book choices all about school preparedness in the run up to the first day of school and your little scholar will feel ready to join in all the kindergarten fun. Here are some great get-ready-for-school books, according to the teachers we asked:\n\nThe Kissing Hand by Audrey Penn\n\nKindergarten, Here I Come! by D. J. Steinberg\n\nWemberly Worried by Kevin Henkes\n\nDavid Goes to School by David Shannon\n\nYou can also incorporate positive \"big kid\" school themes into your child's screen time with shows like Disney Jr.'s Kindergarten: The Musical.\n\n3. Practice the Morning Routine\n\nThe start of a school year can be tricky for many families as everyone has to adapt to new early morning routines coming off of summer vacation. If your child is new to formal education, they might find the busy mornings even more of an adjustment.\n\n\"A key thing to consider when starting school is to focus on making the unknown known as far as possible,\" says Julie Keyes, a teacher of more than 15 years and founder of The Educational Consultant. \"When children are starting school, the shift in their daily routine is dramatic.\"\n\nConsider testing out a few morning practice runs with your child. This will help you and your child anticipate how school days will go and is an excellent opportunity to teach your child all of the things that you'll need to get done in the mornings and what to expect in the afternoons. This way, there are no surprises on the first day of school.\n\nTip Go over the daily classroom schedule with your child if you can. Let them know when story time will occur, when they will have recess, and when they will come home. You can even try practicing the schedule at home to help alleviate fears and uncertainty.\n\n4. Master Basic Skills\n\nChildren who have a few basic skills under their belt tend to feel more comfortable in class, says Mary Reede, a veteran kindergarten teacher. Kindergarten is where children learn basic skills and develop learning habits that will last their entire lives.\n\nIf your child can already count to 10, recognize their name, use child-friendly scissors, hold a pencil, and dress themselves, they'll be ahead of the curve.\n\nYou can help your child practice these skills over the summer in a fun and low-stress way, like coloring and chatting or having a getting-dressed race.\n\n5. Role Play Self-Care Skills\n\nLittle kids need to know how to care for their own needs when they enter kindergarten. That includes going to the bathroom, dressing, and washing their hands. The best way to prepare them for these expectations is to practice, practice, practice!\n\nReede notes that parents need to make sure that their children are washing their hands well and following proper hygiene practices. \"Teach your child to sneeze or blow their nose into a tissue and then throw it away. Get them used to washing their hands properly and resist the urge to take over for the sake of efficiency.\"\n\nYou also can practice opening and closing their lunchbox, as well as the items in it, if they will be bringing their lunch to school. Also, make sure they know how to zip their coat, open and close their backpack, and get their school supplies out when needed.\n\n6. Get Social\n\nKindergarten is a time for making new friendships and learning how to get along with others. Model turn-taking, sharing, and good manners, and try to arrange play dates where your child can practice their social skills. Practice conversation skills with your child while playing with them by:\n\nStarting a conversation (using words such as \"Hello\" and \"Would you like to play\u2026?\")\n\nMaintaining eye contact\n\nAsking questions\n\nTaking turns (speaking and listening)\n\nSpeaking respectfully (using words and phrases like \"please,\" \"excuse me,\" \"thank you,\" etc.)\n\n7. Go Shopping\n\nThere is something fun and almost magical about school shopping. Let your child pick out their new backpack, pencil case, lunch box, and water bottle, then get crafty and customize them together. If your child is anxious about starting school, this activity might be one way to help them get excited.\n\n8. Relax and Let Go\n\nThe most important thing you can do to prepare your child for the first day of kindergarten is simply to relax. Sure, there are the practical things you can do to be ready for school, like labeling your child's clothes with their name and having them practice putting their shoes on the correct foot.\n\nHowever, once children are off at school, parents need to let go and allow their child to explore their new learning environment. \"A child's life before school is a period in its own right, with its own things to learn and experience,\" Taylor explains.\n\n\"We shouldn't be 'preparing' them for school by giving them a (false) head start on the things they will be learning at school. We should be laying foundations to help them be happy, confident little souls who are as independent as they can be. It's about learning life skills, not just school skills,\" she says.", "domain": "www.parents.com"}
