The amount of each food group will vary by age, gender, and activity level ( 1 ).\n\nChildren over the age of 1 will get most of their nutrition from solid food, and it\u2019s important they eat foods from a variety of food groups to meet their vitamin and mineral needs ( 2 ).\n\nCreating healthy eating patterns for children is important for optimal growth and development, building a healthy immune system, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases later in life ( 1 ).\n\nRaising healthy eaters can feel overwhelming, especially as children begin to assert their own opinions about food.\n\nBuilding healthy meal patterns for kids starts at home. You can do many things as a parent to encourage healthy eating.\n\nOffer a wide variety of foods at each sitting\n\nOne of the best ways to encourage healthy eating is to offer a wide variety of nutrient-dense foods at each meal and snack ( 1 ).\n\nAt each meal, aim to serve:\n\na fruit or vegetable\n\nproteins like meat, fish, poultry, tofu, or beans\n\nstarchy vegetables or grains like potatoes, sweet potatoes, bulgur, or rice\n\na fat source like oils, nuts, nut butter, or avocado\n\nEven if your child doesn\u2019t try or like a food the first (or even third) time you serve it, continue to offer those foods at future meals or snacks. Some kids may need to be exposed to a food 8\u201315 times before they decide to eat it ( 1 , 3 ).\n\nWhile the focus should be on offering mostly nutrient-dense foods, it\u2019s important to expose kids to a wide variety of foods to help them build a healthy relationship with food.\n\nThat said, the general advice is to limit added sugar until at least 2 years of age.\n\nThat\u2019s because sugary foods may replace other more nutritious foods in their diets and increase the risk for cavities and metabolic disorders like type 2 diabetes in kids (4, 5 ).\n\nAfter that, it\u2019s okay for your child to occasionally enjoy foods that contain added sugar. However, aim to keep added sugar to less than 10 percent of their total calories (6).\n\nCreate a meal and snack schedule\n\nMost children thrive when there is structure and routine in their day, including for meals. Consistent routines may even help improve behavior among children (7, 8 ).\n\nMeal and snack schedules can play an important role in helping kids build healthy eating habits and promote overall health.\n\nResearch shows that regular meal schedules (instead of all-day grazing) are linked to lower body weight and good metabolism among adults, which may be relevant for children, too ( 8 , 9 , 10 ).\n\nBut perhaps even more important for children, creating a routine around eating times can help them know what to expect and may reduce picky eating and increase food pleasure (11).\n\nWhile exact schedules will vary by age, child, and family, most kids will benefit from eating three meals and two snacks (11).\n\nHere\u2019s an example schedule:\n\nBreakfast: 7 a.m.\n\n7 a.m. Snack: 9\u20139:30 a.m.\n\n9\u20139:30 a.m. Lunch: 12 p.m.\n\n12 p.m. Snack: 3 p.m.\n\n3 p.m. Dinner: 6 p.m.\n\nLimit, but don\u2019t restrict, less nutritious foods\n\nOffering fun foods or those that offer less nutrition is also important to create a healthy relationship with food for kids over the age of 2. Restricting certain foods can have the opposite effect you might be aiming for ( 12 ).\n\nResearch shows that restricting foods (especially those that are highly palatable, like sweets and traditional snack foods) can lead to children eating more of those foods when they have access ( 12 ).\n\nIt may also lead to increased snacking among kids ( 13 ).\n\nFood restriction is also associated with an increased risk of disordered eating, weight gain, and a preoccupation with certain foods ( 12 ).\n\nModel healthy eating habits\n\nIt\u2019s well established that kids exhibit behaviors they learn from their role models.\n\nWhile your child may eat meals with friends at school or other caregivers, they learn many eating habits from you \u2014 the parent or caregiver (14, 15, 16 ).\n\nTherefore, if you want your kids to eat a wide variety of nutritious foods, it\u2019s recommended that you do, too.\n\nResearch has shown a direct link between the number of fruits and vegetables a parent eats with how many their children eat ( 17 ).\n\nOther measures of healthy eating among kids, including self-regulation, diet variety, and healthfulness, are linked to parents\u2019 eating habits and parental modeling ( 18 , 19 , 20 ).\n\nImplement the division of responsibility\n\nThe division of responsibility, a concept developed by Ellyn Satter, helps set roles for the parent and child on eating occasions and has been linked to healthier eating habits and less picky eating ( 21 , 22 ).\n\nTesting tools using Ellyn Satter\u2019s division of responsibility have been validated to predict childhood nutrition risk (23, 24 ).\n\nUsing them has been linked to higher eating competency, better eating, self-regulation, increased consumption of fruits and vegetables among kids, and reduced pickiness ( 21 , 22 ).\n\nIt may even help reduce mealtime battles by taking the pressure off the parent and child and fostering a trusting relationship ( 21 , 22 ).\n\nThe division of responsibility asserts that parents and children have separate roles in eating.\n\nIt is a parent\u2019s job to decide:\n\nWhat is served\n\nWhen meals and snacks are offered (create a meal schedule)\n\nWhere meals occur\n\nIt\u2019s the child\u2019s job to decide:\n\nIf and what they eat among the foods offered\n\nHow much they eat\n\nThis division encourages eating autonomy among children and may result in better feeding self-regulation, meaning kids can honor their hunger and fullness cues ( 21 ).\n\nEat meals as a family\n\nEating meals as a family offers many benefits for children of all ages \u2014 from young toddlers to teenagers.\n\nIt allows parents, siblings, and other family members to model healthy eating behaviors, an important role in kids\u2019 eating habits \u2014 especially younger children ( 1 , 23 ).\n\nIt also provides an opportunity to talk positively about food and connect social behaviors with eating, which may be especially helpful for older children ( 1 ).\n\nIn addition, both family meals and parents modeling healthy eating result in less picky eating and emotional eating among children ( 24 , 25 ).\n\nFamily meals are also linked to better eating habits and a more nutritious diet for kids. Studies also show that kids who eat with their family experience more food enjoyment ( 1 , 26 , 27 ).\n\nWhile studies looking at the connection between the frequency of family meals and healthy eating behaviors among kids suggest that the more you can eat as a family, the better, that may not always be practical ( 19 ).\n\nIf your family\u2019s schedule makes it difficult for everyone to have dinner together, do the best you can.\n\nPerhaps at least one parent can eat breakfast with the kids, or you can eat as a family on weekends or for some dinners during the week.\n\nShop and cook with your kids\n\nInvolving children of all ages \u2014 even young toddlers \u2014 in the cooking process can encourage them to eat a wider variety of foods, be more open to trying new foods, and get them excited about eating ( 1 ).\n\nIn fact, it can take eight to 15 exposures before some children try new food ( 3 ).\n\nResearch shows that repeated food exposures lead to the increased likeliness of a child trying and even liking a food. But think beyond exposures that happen at mealtime ( 3 ).\n\n\u201cThe more food exposure a child has, the better. This includes reading about foods, grocery shopping, helping with meal prep, playing with food, and gardening,\u201d says Amber Rodenas, RD, LDN,", "domain": "www.healthline.com"}
