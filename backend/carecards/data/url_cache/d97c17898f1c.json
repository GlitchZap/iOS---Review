They're beginning to understand language and put words into context. They may not clearly grasp what \"no\" means or that yesterday's \"no\" also applies to today's experience. A 1-year-old hasn't learned how the world works\u2014for instance, they don't realize that a glass vase can smash if it's knocked over. They want what they want now; waiting is extremely difficult, and they have no impulse control.\n\nHow to discipline a 1-year-old\n\nKeep your expectations reasonable. Demonstrate proper behavior, but don't insist on it. Your tone of voice and facial expressions convey lessons best. Be firm yet positive, and don't overreact.\n\nDemonstrate proper behavior, but don't insist on it. Your tone of voice and facial expressions convey lessons best.

If your 18-month-old struggles to stay in the car seat, for example, console them and say that you know they dislike being strapped in but they must do it. Put them in, then divert their attention.\n\n2-Year-Old Discipline Tactics\n\nLife is an emotional roller coaster for a 2-year-old who is beginning to make sense of their feelings. They constantly test their environment to get reactions from others: \"What will happen if I refuse to wear my shoes?\" Children this age have trouble understanding and communicating their powerful\u2014and sometimes overwhelming\u2014emotions. They discover they won't get everything they want and can have frequent tantrums.\n\nHow to discipline a 2-year-old\n\nMinimize power struggles . State your expectations clearly, without yelling. Offer simple choices and don't overestimate their abilities. If necessary, give them an incentive to cooperate. Realize that their job is to test you.\n\n. State your expectations clearly, without yelling. Offer simple choices and don't overestimate their abilities. If necessary, give them an incentive to cooperate. Realize that their job is to test you. Help them begin to master their feelings . If they hit, teach them to use their words (\"I'm mad!\"). Explain, \"We don't hit\" and \"Hitting hurts.\" At about age 2 1/2, they'll start to develop empathy.\n\n. If they hit, teach them to use their words (\"I'm mad!\"). Explain, \"We don't hit\" and \"Hitting hurts.\" At about age 2 1/2, they'll start to develop empathy. Handle tantrums with care. Don't give in to tantrums, but remain close by (and be sure they don't hurt themselves) until it stops. Then direct your child toward positive behavior. Though you shouldn't punish or isolate a 2-year-old with a time-out, you can briefly remove them from a situation to help them calm down.\n\n3-Year-Old Discipline Tactics\n\nYour 3-year-old's budding independence is a source of pride. Though they want to carry out requests that they're capable of doing, such as washing before bedtime, don't count on consistent cooperation. They comprehend the idea of cause and effect\u2014for instance, that breaking the rules has consequences. Tantrums can still be common, but they may also sulk or whine. They're starting to handle frustration better.\n\nHow to discipline a 3-year-old\n\nHelp with tasks . Don't punish your child for not following through on a request. Explain a job simply, get them started on it, and acknowledge their effort.\n\n. Don't punish your child for not following through on a request. Explain a job simply, get them started on it, and acknowledge their effort. Rehearse good behavior. Play games to practice routines. For example, try a get-ready-for-daycare game by playing a song and having your child try to finish three simple tasks before the music stops.\n\nPlay games to practice routines. For example, try a get-ready-for-daycare game by playing a song and having your child try to finish three simple tasks before the music stops. Keep consequences immediate and short. A 3-year-old is now mature enough to handle a time-out of about three minutes (one minute per year of age) if that's a discipline tactic you want to try, but they're less likely to connect the dots between misbehaving now and a consequence later. Head off trouble by averting frustration early and enforcing rules right in the moment.\n\n4-Year-Old Discipline Tactics\n\nYour preschooler's social skills are blossoming, and they may struggle to balance their needs with those of others. They can focus more intently on games and activities\u2014and because of this, making transitions can become especially difficult when they're having fun.\n\nThey may whine more intensely because they're better able to think about what they lack and want. A 4-year-old sometimes bends the truth to fit a private version of reality, but they don't understand that this\u2014as well as cheating\u2014is wrong.\n\nHow to discipline a 4-year-old\n\nAllow plenty of time for transitions . Give your child advance notice, but be mindful that time will mean very little to them, so reminders such as \"we are leaving when this cartoon is over\" will make more sense than \"we are leaving in 15 minutes.\" Additionally, try to avoid power struggles. For instance, consider granting a polite request to stay a few minutes longer at a playdate if there's no pressing need to leave. If they lose control, explain that the two of you will talk as soon as they can calm themselves down.\n\n.

Tell your child that when they talk in a whining voice, you will not listen, and they need to speak to you in a normal voice. When they do, praise them, and respond to the request as you normally would. Handle lies and cheating calmly. Such behavior is normal at this age, but it is important to teach children about honesty. Don't shame your child or dwell on whether they did or didn't do something, but point out that what they said is not true and briefly discuss the importance of being honest. For instance, if they spill a glass of milk and deny doing it, say, \"I know those tumblers are hard to", "domain": "www.parents.com"}
