  "text": "Age 3 is still prime tantrum time, but you can start to see some light at the end of the tunnel. Here’s more about tantrums at this age — what they look like, how you can deal with them, and when you might want to make an appointment with your pediatrician.\n\nAs your child gets older, though, you might wonder how long tantrums last and — more importantly — if your child’s behavior is still considered normal.\n\nBy the time your child is 3, you may be a pro at this temper tantrum thing. After all, tantrums can strike whether you’re at home or out and about, and sometimes when you least expect them. It’s natural to be on guard in the early years.\n\nFor the most part, tantrums are a completely normal part of life for young kids. They should fade once your child is able to better communicate their feelings and needs.\n\nKids may start having tantrums around their first birthdays, and it’s common for tantrums to continue until age 2 or 3 — sometimes longer. Still, you may worry that your little one seems out of control or that the tantrums might result in harm. You may even be concerned that your 3-year-old’s tantrums are a sign that something else is going on.\n\nTantrums happen when they don’t know how to fully express themselves or when they don’t know how to do something they desperately want to do. You may also notice outbursts when your child is particularly tired, hungry, or sick.\n\nYour preschooler has lots of big feelings and opinions, as well as a growing desire for independence.\n\nIt may be difficult to decode a tantrum just by looking at one. Over time, though, you may notice patterns in timing (before bedtime or between meals) or situations (going to preschool or at a toy store) that will help clue you in.\n\nIt’s helpful to gain an understanding of different types of tantrums so you can decode what your child is trying to tell you.\n\nBefore anything else, you’ll want to make sure your child is safe. Particularly when it comes to rage tantrums, this may mean physically removing your child from the area where they’re having their tantrum.\n\nAnd if injury is a concern, you may want to hold your child in your arms.\n\nLook away\n\nOne of the best ways to deal with a tantrum is to stay calm and ignore the behavior. If your child is throwing a tantrum to get your attention, ignoring it takes away their audience. At the same time, you’ll want to “ignore” while still paying attention to make sure your child is safe.\n\nRedirect\n\nIf you catch a tantrum early enough, you might be able to redirect your child’s attention to another task or activity. This works well with frustration tantrums.\n\nIf you notice your child is having trouble with a toy, consider directing their attention to another age-appropriate toy, puzzle, or game. If you’re in public, you might also try changing your location to get away from an environment, like a swing set, that’s triggering tantrums.\n\nModel verbal expression of feelings\n\nThree-year-olds have an advantage over younger tots in that you can start teaching them ways to cope with their very big emotions. After your child calms down a bit, try saying something like: “Temper tantrums are not the way to get mommy’s attention. Let’s try to use our words to share how we feel.”\n\nWhile this won’t immediately result in your child divulging their deepest emotions in an intelligible way, you’ll begin the important work needed for them to verbally express their feelings.\n\nTake a time-out\n\nIf a tantrum is particularly violent or disruptive, you may want to try giving your child some space through a time-out.\n\nAn appropriate range of time for time-outs at this age is between 2 and 5 minutes or around a minute per year old. You can have a designated spot or send your child to their room, provided you feel it’s a safe environment.\n\nModel good coping skills\n\nYou may also want to look at how you handle your own troubles during the day. Your child is watching you. So, if you have frequent outbursts, try taking a step back and reacting more calmly.\n\nWhile you’re at it, when your child does calm down from a tantrum, be sure to praise them for their progress (without giving in to whatever caused the tantrum in the first place).\n\nBe consistent\n\nNo matter what you do, consistency is key. It can be tiring when you feel your child is constantly having tantrums, but responding in the same way will pay off in time.",
